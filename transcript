Meeting Transcript: Weekly Standup

Sarah (Dev Lead):
Good morning, team. Let's go around for updates. My main focus this week is on resolving the database connection bug. It's been quite frustrating to track down.

John (Frontend Dev):
I'm working on the user interface for the new dashboard feature. I hit a small delay yesterday but it's back on track now. I'll ensure the designs are fully implemented by end of day.

Emily (QA):
I'm starting the testing phase for John's dashboard work today. I found a minor issue with the login flow during a quick check, nothing major, but it's something to look at. We need to prioritize stability for the upcoming release.

Mike (Product Owner):
Thanks for the updates, everyone. Sarah, let me know if you need any help with that bug. John, great to hear you're on schedule. Emily, please keep me informed about any critical bugs. We want to ensure a smooth launch.

Sarah (Dev Lead):
Will do, Mike. I think I'm close to a solution. I'll give a final update tomorrow.
